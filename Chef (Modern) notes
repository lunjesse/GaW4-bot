Food addresses: 0x03C748, 0x03C75C, 0x03C770

Offsets:
+0x0 - Food exists bool
+0x2 - Which spot it will land on (x-pos, sorta) ranges 0-4
+0x5 - Food "timer"; it's y-pos is determined by it
+0x6 - Minimum value timer can be in to land on frying pan
+0x7 - X position food sprite should be in
+0x8 - If it has been cooked or just thrown; 52 if just thrown, 0 if landed on frying pan before
+0x9 - How many times has the food bounced on pan so far
+0xA - Food state; 0 is raw, 1 is cooked, 2 is burnt

Types of food:
Egg: 3 bounces to cook; max timer 96
Pepper: 4 bounces to cook; max timer 144
Fish: 4 bounces to cook; max timer 112
Steak: 5 bounces to cook; max timer 128
Lobster: 5 bounces to cook; max timer 96
Heart: 0 bounces to cook; max timer 144

Seems 2 bounces after cooking it burns it, and the bounce afterwards destroys it. +10 after the min value timer causess the food to be either eaten by Yoshi or drop to the floor.

Yoshi x-pos (sorta): 0x03C358 (ranges 0-4)
Yoshi's state: 0x03C35A (0 - baby, 1 - adult, 2 - egg follower)
How much food eaten in current state: 0x03C35B
Raw foods reset counter to 0. Cooked foods increment by 1. Burnt foods lowers state by 1 (or stun if state is 0)

Yoshi pauses a bit when transitioning states, so might want to take account into that and potentially burn some food.

Takes 5 foods to go from state 0 (baby) to state 1 (adult)
Takes 5 foods to go from state 1 (adult) to state 2 (egg follower)
Takes 6 foods to go from state 2 (egg follower) back to state 0 (baby). This pauses the food's flying, but gives 20 points

Starts throwing 4 foods by 185 points in easy. Seems to be capped at 4 foods, but in hard mode it can start spawning on the right. On Super Hard, food may fly around every time it's bounced.
