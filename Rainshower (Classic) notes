The purpose of the game is to move your shirts around the hangers, to avoid getting them wet from the tear shaped raindrops.

The shirts have the following addresses in BizHawk: 0x03C1E8, 0x03C1E9, 0x03C1EA, 0x03C1EB
In game, they correspond to the top left shirt, top right shirt, bottom left shirt, and bottom right shirt.

Your position is at 0x03C1E4, and can have 4 values.

Each shirt can only be at 2 spots at a time. So they take the values 0 and 1 only.

The drops have the following addresses in Easy mode: 0x03ABBA, 0x03AB3E, 0x03AC36, 0x03ACB2
Up to 4 water drops can appear at once. Additionally, in "Hard" mode, a raven may appear and change the clothes' states. The ravens make use of the addresses 0x03ABBA, 0x03AB3E. So we need to check the game's difficulty setting, and assign the tears instead as:

Hard mode droplets: 0x03AD2E, 0x03ADAA, 0x03AC36, 0x03ACB2

These are all structs for the droplets. You can offset them by the following to get:
+0x0 - The states the drop should be, vertical-wise (y-position)
+0xF - If it's a raven or droplet. 0x65 means droplet and 0x68 means raven
+0x14 - The states the drop should be, horizontal-wise (x-position)

For the horizontal positions, it can only be at values decimal-wise
Left side of the house: 52, 80, 108, 136
Right side of the house: 164, 192, 220, 248

Recall the shirts from above. Given their states, they are affected as follows:
0x03C1E8 (Top left shirts)
when at 0, it can be splashed when drops are at positions 52 and 108
when at 1, it can be splashed when drops are at positions 80 and 136

0x03C1E9 (Top right shirt)
when at 0, it can be splashed when drops are at position 220
when at 1, it can be splashed when drops are at position 192

0x03C1EA (Bottom left shirt)
when at 0, it can be splashed when drops are at position 80
when at 1, it can be splashed when drops are at position 108

0x03C1EB (Bottom right shirts)
when at 0, it can be splashed when drops are at positions 192 and 248
when at 1, it can be splashed when drops are at positions 164 and 220

Top shirts get splashed at the next game tick when the y-position of the tears are at 3, and the shirts states are at the values shown above. Bottom shirts get splashed at the next game tick when the y-position of the tears are at 5. Combining these facts together gives the script.
Combining these facts together, we get the script.

Unused info:
0x03C461 - Game tick for right sided tears
0x03C462 - Game tick for left sided tears

03C461 counts up to a value, then turns to 1. 03C462 then starts looping, and after it reaches the same max value, it repeats.
