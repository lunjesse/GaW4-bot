blocks to move when value
right char (03C138)
2 (bottom)
20 (middle)
38 (top)

left char (03C139)
11 (bottom)
29 (middle)
47 (top)

Format for block address
03C140 - state; 0 == done; 1 == alive; 5 == carried 
03C141 - convoyer belt array pos
03C142 - 1 if moving right, 0 if moving left

03C140 block 1
03C144 block 2
03C148 block 3

etc. use 03C12E and a for loop to get all blocks without listing them explicitly

03C12D seems to be tick length; ie. how fast the game is
the blocks move alternately, determined by 03C12B

Easy mode starts at 2 blocks, and reaches up to 6 blocks by 900 points onward.
Hard mode starts at 3 blocks, and reaches up to 6 blocks by 600 points onward. It reaches 7 blocks by 780 points onward.
